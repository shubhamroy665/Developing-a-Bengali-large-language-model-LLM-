What did you do?
What did you...?
- Nothing!
- Nothing?
Bullshit!
Fuck, he's bleeding to death.
They still coming?
- They still behind us?
- I can't see them.
Shit, he's bleeding a lot.
- Stop the bleeding.
- I can't.
- Use your finger.
- There's too much.
Here come those bastards.
Faster!
Fuck!
Faster!
Motherfuckers!
- Fucking hell!
- Watch out!
- Shit, he fell.
- Is he dead?
Why did you fuck with those bastards?
Is he dead?
Answer me!
No, but he keeps falling.
He's bleeding even more!
- I've covered his wound.
- Get down!
They've got a fucking gun!
Motherfucker!
Hurry!
Let's go to Chilaquil's.
Motherfucker!
- Faster.
- Get down, man.
Step on it!
The window!
The window, that's it!
Octavio and Susana
Are you ready?
What's your stake?
10,000.
Okay for 10,000?
Let's go.
You're on for 10.
10's the stake, senores.
10 on Pancho, 10 on Turco.
Heat 'em up!
Marks!
Let them go!
Cofi!
Cofi!
Cofi, come here!
Fucking dog!
Hello, senora.
How's he been?
Better.
The fever broke.
Susana, I can't watch him tomorrow.
Why?
I have to help my sister move, and go to the market.
Senora, give me a break!
I have a match final.
I'll iron tonight.
No.
Leave the kid with your mother.
My mother?
Just this week.
Then I'll work it out.
No.
I raised my children, now you raise yours.
Go on, Turco!
Do I stop it?
He'll kill him.
It's cool.
He's back on top.
Kill him!
- What's up, Ma?
- Sit down and eat.
How's it going, little dude?
- How's he doing?
- Better.
Thank you.
Know what?
A baby born in Guadalajara gets a finger up his ass.
- Why?
- To see what he'll be.
If he kicks, he'll be a soccer player.
If he screams, a mariachi.
And if he laughs, he'll be a homo.
What about girls?
We finger them until they're 18.
Stop bullshitting, Octavio.
Susana?
Susana?
Did you bleach my uniform?
Look at it!
And Cofi?
Where is that fucking dog?
- No "hello"...?
- Where?
- I don't know.
- Sit and eat.
You let him out again, right, bitch?
I always tell you to watch it when you go out!
- Lay off!
- Who asked you?
You don't care about that dog.
I feed it.
This is between me and my wife.
I'm the one who let him go, so lay off her.
Keep out of it!
Shut up, please.
Here's your dough, less 500 for my cut.
10 victories in a row!
- Just luck, fatso.
- Cool.
- See you Saturday.
- Okay.
What about your fucking dog?
Barbecue it if you'd like, shithead!
Champinon, move that dog!
Fucking dog can't get enough!
Give him to me.
He won't budge.
Sic him on those dogs.
That will cool him off.
Good idea.
It's in the bag.
- Hey, that's Octavio's dog.
- Exactly.
- Can I?
- Yes.
Thanks for earlier.
What?
That was cool, taking the blame.
What happened here?
It's nothing.
Did Ramiro do this to you?
Yes, but he didn't mean it.
Didn't mean it?
You know what he's like.
Why do you put up with it?
He treats you like shit.
Not always.
Are you stupid or just pretending?
Someone's here for you.
- Hang on.
- Uh-huh.
You know Ramiro doesn't want Susana in your room.
We were watching TV!
Your brother doesn't like it, neither do I.
It's the last time, you hear me?
The last!
- What's up?
- You won't believe it.
What?
Your dog killed Jarocho's Pancho.
What happened?
Jarocho sicced Pancho on Cofi, but Cofi saw him coming.
He snapped his neck and killed him.
- Where's Cofi?
- Here he comes.
Cofi!
Here!
He's all right.
The other dogs didn't touch him.
What gives, Octavio?
Know what your dog did?
- Yeah.
- So?
It's okay, huh?
It's cool.
Cool?
It's not cool at all.
Bring Pancho.
See what he did?
This dog was worth at least 20,000 pesos.
Have him stuffed for your mantel.
Don't be a smartass, kiddo.
You have two choices.
Pay me, or pay me.
Why should I pay you?
Want to play with me?
Okay.
Wait!
Why did you set Pancho on him?
Listen, give me your dog, and I'll forget it.
You're nuts.
Start saving, 'cause you're gonna pay.
Make Ramiro pay if you're so cool.
Afraid he'll kick your ass again?
No way, asshole.
I'm not taking any more shit.
Got it, Octavio?
Let's go.
What's up?
Got a joint?
Ramiro, I need money.
Don't got any.
Payday's Friday.
So what do I do?
The baby needs diapers and formula, and the eggs you eat aren't free.
- Got no money.
- "Got no money".
So you got no money?
Are you deaf?
Aren't drugstores good business?
Keep your mouth shut, or else.
Asshole!
One word and you're dead.
Being tough won't make you smart.
- Jimena took my headband.
- Give it back.
It's my headband!
No, it was a gift.
Liar, I bought it at the store.
Give it to her.
You never wear it.
I'll get it!
Hello?
Hello?
- Who was it?
- They hung up.
That mute man again?
Or that mute woman, maybe?
I'll get it.
Hello?
Hello?
Hung up again.
Weird!
Can I come in?
What's up?
You going out?
Why?
No reason.
Something wrong?
I...
What happened?
I'm in trouble.
I don't know what to do.
I'm pregnant again.
Shit, Susana, you want another baby already?
I didn't want it!
Ramiro is going to kill me.
No, he won't.
He went nuts once, but he still married you, didn't he?
Yes, but I don't know if I want to stay with him.
I can't have this baby, Octavio.
Are you thinking about an abortion?
Do you have a better idea?
What the fuck can I do?
Come away with me.
What?
Let's go away.
Far away.
I'm being serious!
So am I.
Don't talk shit.
Where would we go?
- What are you doing, you jerk?
- Come away with me.
- How many are they?
- Six bitches, three dicks.
- Ready?
- Wait.
That fat bitch is going in.
I smell cash.
Ever fucked a fatso like her?
- I have, it's hot.
- You have?
Who?
Your mother, asshole.
Someday we'll do that fucking bank, you'lI see.
Keep cool, Tarzan.
We're going big time, man.
After that fucking bank, I'm out of here.
It's not safe around here.
We're on, she's in.
Everyone down on the floor!
BUSINESSMAN MURDERED MOTIVE UNKNOWN
MR. EZQUERRA'S WIDOW, MRS. NORMA SAINZ, DIED
FUNERAL AT 10:30 A.M.
What's up?
Want some dinner?
Look what I brought you.
Cool!
No way!
For me?
Like it?
Was a bitch to get it.
Shh!
Don't shout, you'll wake the baby.
Hang on.
Baldy?
- Don't wake him.
- Why not?
It was hard to get him to sleep.
I never see him, do I, Baldy?
He's been puking all day.
He's sick.
Selfish bastard!
Shut the fuck up.
I gave you the Walkman!
I'm cool to you, but you're always on my ass!
The baby, shit!
Shut up!
Wow, dude...
she's your brother's woman.
Yeah, but I always liked her, even before they met.
But he got her first.
My ass!
Ramiro doesn't care about her.
But Susana does.
You're playing with fire, man.
I can't stop thinking about her.
There's thousands of bitches.
Why do you want to fuck her?
I don't want to fuck her!
I want her to leave with me.
Yeah?
With what money?
You're going to fight him?
Where do we get the bet money?
- I'll pimp your sister.
- You asshole!
Well?
Phone call for Susana.
Who is it?
Her mother.
Tell her to fuck off.
She says it's urgent.
Hello?
Hello?
Who was it?
Me.
You're nuts.
What's wrong with you?
Let go.
Let go.
No, Octavio.
Not this way.
Then how?
This dog looks pretty sad to me.
But it killed Jarocho's dog.
You know this business?
More or less.
More or less?
- Sargento?
- Yes.
Sarge, take this dog.
Come with me.
This is my business.
Zero taxes, zero strikes, zero unions.
Pure hard cash.
I take a loss now and then.
This is Mac, my best investment.
He's old, but he can still fight.
I got the van from his winnings.
We can be partners, with your dog, and my stake money.
We'll split the profits 50-50.
What do you think?
- Sounds good.
- Good.
Good for eight fights, then we'lI see.
Fine.
But first, your dog goes a round with Mac.
Okay, it will cost you 5,000, win or lose.
Don't bullshit me.
What if your dog kills mine?
And what if mine dies?
But I don't have a van yet.
I'll give you 2,500.
Will that do?
Done.
Condom!
Bring Mac.
Here's your take.
Release them on three.
Count.
One... two... three!
That's enough.
Take your fucking dog.
Sarge!
Come back on Saturday at 12:00.
It's payback time for Jarocho.
- 20 is your change.
- Thank you.
Did you find everything you needed?
Except rubbers.
You don't have my size.
What the fuck are you doing here?
Shopping.
Where did you get the dough?
You don't have money, but I do.
Stick it up your ass.
I'll buy my family's things.
Ring me up, or I'll call the manager.
Asshole, get out or you're dead.
I'm not Susana, you know.
You don't scare me.
- What happened?
- Nothing, nothing.
Fucking hell!
Good afternoon.
- Take it.
- What for?
So you can take care of him.
And him.
Yes?
Hey, brother, how are you?
I'm very well.
No, not much.
Hang on.
I can't hear anything.
Neither can I. Why don't you leave?
What's up?
I couldn't get away.
Tomorrow, I promise.
I miss you, too.
Don't call here anymore, Julieta's suspicious.
No, I'm not angry.
Tomorrow at 11:00.
I love you.
What's the matter?
Stop!
Stop, man!
Keep out of my business, asshole!
Here, pal, take this.
- What's up, fatso?
- Just hanging, Jarocho.
Why are you playing with girls?
Because they got mean dogs.
You're betting 15 on it?
My dog beats all of yours.
I'm talking to the ringmaster, princess.
So...
- 15?
- Make it 10.
Okay.
Place your bets, senores.
Waste him!
Kill him!
Ready?
Let them go!
I'll catch up.
What are you doing here?
Taking a stroll.
Stroll elsewhere.
Don't mess with us, and especially not her.
It's a free country, isn't it?
To her, you're dead.
Don't forget that.
You're hostile, sister-in-law!
That's two you owe me.
Don't be pissed, Jarochito.
Win some, lose some.
What's up?
Here.
It's yours.
But hide it, or my brother will take it.
Don't worry.
Got another place to stash it?
Yes.
I put that other money in a case in the closet.
Shh!
The baby's sleeping!
This will be our bank, okay?
Just yours and mine.
Octavio, you stealing too?
No.
This money's clean, so you'll come away with me.
Come away with you?
You still don't get it, do you?
No, you don't get it.
Jorge has cousins in Juarez.
We'll go there.
We can open a store, we got cash.
It'll be cool.
No, I don't want any more trouble.
Can't you understand?
Understand?
Come away with me.
Golden and growing ripe in my land
I'm ready to fly while my people await
Twigs I go around sowing to see if they sprout
Northern wind, thought and life
I carry St. Peter in my breath and the saliva I spit
Anytime I feel right
And I do it complete and directly
Yes, sir
Yes, sir, Coming, coming, coming, coming
Yes, sir
Wind, caresses, levity and flavor
Yes, sir
Yes, sir, Coming, coming, coming, coming
Yes, sir
Fire, smiles, reality and pain
The ground is present
Waiting, representing, it comes down at night
Singing me to sleep, I'm unconscious
On my belly the seconds pass
Charged, tattooed on my back, soaking wet
Joined to spasms of crying and laughter
I've been around, slowly but carefully
Just as slow as the moment that doesn't end
Just as slow, crossing through the thorns
Tell me what it feels like, tell me what it feels like
Tell me what it feels like, the sweat in your brow
Tell me what it feels like, tell me what it feels like
Tell me what it feels like, the sweat in your brow
Yes, sir
Yes, sir, Coming, coming, coming, coming
Yes, sir
Wind, caresses, levity and flavor
Yes, sir
Yes, sir, Coming, coming, coming, coming
Yes, sir...
I didn't say you could come in.
What are you watching?
None of your business.
Change that shit.
I don't like it.
What do you want?
I heard you're getting rich with my dog.
Your car is nice.
Your dog?
He's mine.
Don't talk shit, little brother!
He's as much mine as yours, so I get half of the winnings.
Anyway, look at him.
Doesn't look like you care about him much.
I care more than you know.
Give you money?
I'm not giving you shit.
It's simple... cough it up, or I'll blow your piggy bank away.
Next time's for real, so you better get me my dough.
"The cock crows..."
What's up, Baldy?
Look what I got you!
Look at all this!
Your mom's going to put it away.
We're millionaires!
There's enough to live on for two years.
Come live them with me.
What do you say, eh?
- Why, Octavio?
- Why what?
Why do you want to live them with me?
You still don't get it?
No, I do get it.
Give Jorge something to eat.
I've got some business for you.
Jarocho's got a class A dog.
He wants to fight Cofi.
Yeah, right!
He'll bet 40,000.
40?
You in?
That's too much for me.
You're on your own.
What about our deal?
The deal was for eight fights.
We've done 15.
That's enough.
You won, I won, that's it.
Okay.
When does he want to fight?
This Saturday.
He wants it private, at Trujillo's.
No outside bets, just you and him.
All right.
Do I confirm?
Okay.
Hey, fatso,
I need you to do me a big favor.
A giants' joust turns the air into natural gas
A wild duel warns me
How close I am of going into an outrageous world
I feel my fragility
Some nightmare running away
With a beast after me
Tell me everything's a lie
Just a silly dream and nothing more
I'm afraid of enormity
Where nobody hears my voice
Stop the deception
Don't try to hide
That you've never tripped while moving around
Paper monster
I don't know who I'm up against
Or is there somebody else here?
I believe in the terrible ghosts
Of some strange place
And in my foolishness to make you burst into laughter
In an outrageous world
I feel your fragility
Stop the deception
Don't try to hide
That you've never tripped while moving around
Paper monster
I don't know who I'm up against...
How's the baby?
Good.
Growing, I guess.
Got a name yet?
Umm... if it's a girl, Susana.
And if it's a boy?
Octavio?
Everything's ready.
We leave Sunday.
But I'm going to need some of the money.
Saturday's the big one.
Don't fight him anymore.
We've got enough.
One last one?
What time is the bus to Juarez?
It leaves at 12:00.
Ramiro will still be at work.
Don't worry about Ramiro.
He won't fuck with us anymore, I'm sure.
Are you scared?
It's heavy shit.
Scared?
Ma?
Ma?
Ma?
So this is how you take care of the kid?
Shh!
What's wrong?
Now you can stay drunk.
What's up, Ma?
Do you know what happened to your brother?
He didn't come home last night.
No idea.
You don't know?
He got beat up bad.
He must have pissed off a customer.
They threatened to kill him.
God knows what he's up to!
He left with the baby and Susana.
Where to?
I don't know where.
Or if they'll be back.
What?
Goddamn it!
Motherfucker!
And that bitch!
People Today
With us today, someone no man would want to miss... one of the most beautiful women in Iberian America,
Valeria Amaya!
Thank you so much.
I have to find her, damn it!
She tricked you.
I warned you.
It wasn't her.
It was Ramiro, that asshole.
This is your year.
You represent "Enchant" in Latin America, loads of models envy you...
I'll find her!
How much you got?
- 7,000, and you?
- 10,000.
I hope Jarocho will go with that.
I've got 3,000 at home, I'll loan them to you.
That woman's hot!
Is it true you have a new love?
Yes, it's notjust a rumor.
In fact, he's here.
My love!
Andres Salgado, no less!
Please, have a seat.
What a lucky guy!
Let's go.
Cofi!
Okay, one more personal question.
Will you two get married?
Not right away, but we have a son... and I brought him.
Richie!
Isn't he cute!
He looks just like Andres!
He's got my white hair.
What's up?
You didn't back out?
- As you can see.
- You get the 40,000?
- I only got 20,000.
- Will that do?
You're on.
Playing for candy!
Sargento, put the dogs in the pool.
Ready!
On your marks!
Release them!
You crazy fucker!
Fight's over!
He was winning!
Why did you shoot?
- Itjust went off.
- What's this shit?
It's between you and him.
Here's your money.
And yours.
This isn't fair, Mauricio!
Work it out between you.
Don't be crybabies.
That's the business.
You better scram, before things heat up.
Complain to your brother.
I'll be waiting for him!
- Where are you going?
- Start the car, wait for me.
Forget something,princess?
What did you do?
- What did you...
- Nothing!
Nothing?
Bullshit!
- Is he dead?
- No!
Why did you fuck with those bastards?
Assholes!
Thanks to Valeria Amaya and Andres Salgado for being on the show.
Friends, stay with us for more surprises on "People Today".
Valeria, I thought you were with someone else.
Well, now you know.
So many rumors.
People love gossip.
- Laura, 20 seconds!
- Right, goodbye.
- What are you doing now?
- Nothing, why?
Have lunch with me.
No thanks, Andres.
You would say no to Andres Salgado?
Listen, the show's over.
The show is over.
I have a surprise you'll love.
Okay, let's go.
- Where are you going?
- To the restaurant.
I said lunch, I didn't say where.
- Come in.
- Did you buy this place?
- Not exactly.
- It's lovely!
- You like it?
- Of course!
This couch is just like mine.
It's not like yours.
It is yours.
In the bedroom, you'll find your clothes, your perfumes...
What are you playing at?
That's not all.
Look at the view!
You like it?
You've gone too far.
I'm going.
Wait!
Take the keys to your apartment.
What do you mean, my apartment?
That's right, you're home!
Idiots!
Darling!
What's this hole?
I had enough to buy it, but not to fix it.
Okay, enough!
- You're jealous.
- Thanks!
I've never seen you acting so well.
You liked it?
- I love you, too.
- Sorry.
I was joking.
Bye!
Wow!
Thanks.
Thanks for the magazine cover.
Good luck, matador.
My love, is it really true?
- Honey?
- What?
I spoke with Julieta.
And?
As of today, we're separated.
You're not lying to me?
Starting tonight, we can sleep together.
Are you sure about this?
I am.
Have you changed your mind?
I just can't believe it!
- Darling?
- Yes?
What shall we toast with?
Ah, I knew I forgot something.
Please, keep an eye on the food.
You know I can't fry an egg.
You're my special guest!
A guest in my own home?
You are the guest.
Stay here.
Darling...
Richie!
- Come over here.
- Hurry back.
You bet I will.
Corazon...
Mi corazon
Corazon...
mi corazon
Richie!
Shut up!
What's the matter?
Corazon...
Mi corazon...
Daniel and Valeria
Excuse us.
So?
It's hard to diagnose... massive blood loss, double fractured tibia and fibula, open fractured femur... the femoral biceps are almost completely severed.
- It's a miracle she's alive.
- Will she make it?
I hope so.
When can I see her?
I don't know... in two days, depending on how she recovers.
Is there a relative I should notify?
Her family's in Spain.
I don't know if I should tell them.
Will you take the responsibility?
- Thanks, Nacho.
- No problem.
My regards to Julieta.
Sorry, it's habit.
Kiss your girls for me.
No problem.
One, two, three.
Don't tire her out.
No.
I'll never play soccer again.
Shh!
Take it easy.
And Richie?
He's fine, he's at home.
Our home...
Our home...
- Daniel...
- Huh?
Don't tell my father.
- Isn't it time you spoke to him?
- I don't want to.
He'd say I deserved it.
Okay.
Don't worry.
Sleep... sleep.
I'm here with you.
- Daniel?
- Huh?
Are you awake?
What is it?
Daniel, I'm scared.
Look at me!
Don't worry, they'll take it off.
You've been very brave.
The truth is...
I'm scared to death.
You'll be fine, you'lI see.
Richie, look!
Look who's here!
- Your mommy is back.
- Richie!
I missed you, my little one.
What did you do without me?
My love!
Welcome home, my love!
The first one to blink loses, eh?
No!
You lose, you lose!
What are you doing?
I'm examining you.
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.
I can't.
Yes, you can.
Let's see how you do it.
Sure you'll be all right?
Sure.
I'm an expert.
Left... right...
What if you need something?
I've got Richie, don't I?
Whatever you do, stay seated.
- Even if the earth quakes?
- Let it crumble.
But you don't leave that chair!
- I'll be back by 8:00.
- I'll be here.
- Good luck.
- I'll miss you.
Fetch, sweetheart.
Good.
Bring it back.
Good, Richie.
You're a good boy.
Bring me the ball.
Run, run!
No, Richie!
Shit!
Richie!
Richie, good boy!
Richie?
Richie!
Mommy's here!
Richie!
It's me!
I'm in the kitchen.
How did it go?
From the doctor, so I don't have to carry you.
How's my princess?
Richie went into the hole.
How?
He was running after the ball.
He'll get out.
That was five hours ago.
What can we do?
- I know!
- What are you doing?
Chocolates.
He'll come right out.
Wait, I'm coming with you.
Here, try the crutches.
Why won't he come out?
He must be stuck down there.
Don't worry about it, he'll come out.
Richie?
I tried that.
I hear noises, but he won't come out.
Don't worry, he'll come out.
You want an omelet?
I'm hungry.
He's all right.
A bit disoriented, but he's here, not stolen, not lost.
He's here with us, okay?
Daniel...
- Daniel?
- What?
Listen, it's Richie.
Yes, it's him.
- So?
- Wait.
Richie?
Richie?
Richie?
- Richie?
- Daniel?
- What?
- Hurry, I think I heard him.
- Where is he?
- Help me.
Careful.
He's under the living room.
Richie, darling...
Richie?
Oh, shit!
That scared me!
Hello?
Hello?
- Who was it?
- I don't know.
They hung up.
Richie?
Manuel, bastard!
Where have you been?
Working, dear.
How are you?
- I'm getting there.
- Take it easy, huh?
In a month, if all goes well,
I'll be back on the Enchant campaign.
Enchant?
Forget about that.
What do you mean?
Listen, the contract with Enchant is finished.
- They pulled out?
- What did you expect?
They hired you when you were well.
Be realistic, you're not well.
When you get well, like before, we'll contact Enchant and it'll be fine...
Richie!
Jesus, Richie!
Shit!
